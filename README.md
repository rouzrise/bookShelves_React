## MyReads Project Overview
Restaurant Reviews is a project completed within Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. 
This is an application that allows you to select and categorize books that you have read, is currently reading, or want to read.

## How to start

To start using App git clone or download it from [github]()
After cloning or downloading the App - cd to the folder in Terminal.
Be sure you have React installed locally and globally (also you'll need 'react-router-dom' and 'prop-types' installed).

If you are not sure - just run 
`npm i --save prop-types react react-dom react-router-dom` and `npm i --save-dev react-scripts`

After that run `npm start` to open the Browser tab with working App.

## What You can do with the App

#### Search for Books 
Click '+' button in the right low corner and go to the serach page. Look for the book you want.

#### Put the book to the shelf
After searching you can add book to the shelf you want.
There are three shelves:
-Currently Reading
-Want to Read
-Read

#### Rate book
You can set rating for any book (Please note - the rating won't keep after page refresh).

#### Move book from one shelf to another
If you want - you can move the book between shelves. Just click the select sign in the low right corner of each book to choose the self.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
